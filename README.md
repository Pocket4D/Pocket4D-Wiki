# Background
Mini-Programs are very much in line with the decentralized characteristics of the blockchain, and the social properties of Mini-Programs should also be able to be well integrated with the blockchain.

Pocket4D, as an open platform for Mini-Programs, provides Mini-Programs service for the majority of `host` Apps. Pocket4D integrates a series of service, such as cryptocurrecies prices inquiry, wallets of cryptocurrency, COVID-19 inquiry, voting system, blockchain mobile games and other kinds of Mini-Programs, so that host apps do not need to interface with different platforms, only need to access Pocket4D once!. It is ready for one-click integration, providing a low-cost way to realize its business and enrich the application ecosystem.
Pocket4D supports private deployment and IPFS protocol. Therefore, we can not only provide ordinary Mini-Programs open service, but also provide a blockchain-based Mini-Programs echosystem to bring the Mini-Programs into the world of blockchain, so that the user experience of the blockchain Dapps is on par with ordinary apps.

By accessing the Pocket4D platform, `hosting` apps enables:
- Optimizing the Dapp user experience
