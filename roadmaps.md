# Roadmaps
The Pocket4D is a very long-term project, and heavily developing. We consider it to be months or years to become a mature project.

Here's our roadmaps.

## Year 2020
### Proof of concept #0, end of Sep.2020
1. With js/html/css bundled to a local server.
2. A runnable android app with an entrance to display apps on the server.
3. One single tap to download and display the `mini-program` to the android host, using native-rendering method.

### Proof of concept #1, end of Oct.2020
1. Deploy the bundled file to a decentralized storage, IPFS for example.
2. Provides standard `mini-program` defined `xml` and `API` to javascript frontend.
3. Integrate `Web3` and provide to frontend.
4. Use smart contracts to deploy an Dapp ,such as Faucet, and use `mini-app` to interact with it.

### Proof of concept #2, end of Nov.2020
1. Integrate with `WalletConnect` and provides to Javascript.
2. When signing, call `WalletConnect` and use deeplink to jump to the wallet app and finish signing, and then go back to the `mini-app`.
3. The backend use `Substrate` to host a blockchain with decentralized storage.
   
### Proof of concept #3, end of DEC.2020
1. Complete most of the `mini-program` defined components and APIs.
2. A complete guidelines for developers(host) to integrate the SDK.
3. Small scale integration of Dapps and host apps (eg. wallet or Dex) for testing.
   
### Stage 1, end of March 2021
1. A test blockchain with decentralized storage.
2. A developer portal for Pocket4D.
3. Present an economic model.
