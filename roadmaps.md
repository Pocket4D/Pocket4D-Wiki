# Roadmaps
The Pocket4D is a very long-term project, and heavily developing. We consider it to be months or years to become a mature project.
Here's our roadmaps.

## Year 2020
### Proof of concept #0, end of Sep.2020
1. With js/html/css bundled to a local server
2. An android app runnable with an entrance to display apps on the server
3. One single tap to download and display the `mini-program` to the android host, using native-rendering method.

### Proof of concept #1, end of Oct.2020
1. Deploy the bundled file to a decentralized storage, IPFS for example
2. Provides standard `mini-program` defined `xml` and `api` to javascript frontend
3. Integrate `Web3` and provides to frontend
4. Use smart contract to deploy an Dapp eg. Faucet, and use `mini-app` to interact with.

### Proof of concept #2, end of Nov.2020
1. Integrate with `WalletConnect` and provides to javascript
2. When signing, call `WalletConnect` and use deeplink to jump to wallet and sign, then goback to `mini-app`
3. The Backend use `Substrate` to host a blockchain with decentralized storage.
   
### Proof of concept #3, end of DEC.2020
1. Complete most of the `mini-program` defined components and apis.
2. A complete guide for developer(host) to integrate the sdk.
3. A small scale integrating test for Dapps and Host Apps(eg. wallets or Dex)
   
### Stage 1, end of March 2021
1. A test blockchain with decentralized storage
2. A developer portal for Pocket4D
